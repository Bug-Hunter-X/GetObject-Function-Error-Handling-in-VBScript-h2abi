# GetObject Function Error Handling in VBScript

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `GetObject` function in VBScript and provides a solution for handling it gracefully.  The `GetObject` function can fail if the specified object doesn't exist, leading to runtime errors and application crashes.  This example showcases the problem and a robust solution.

## Problem
The `GetObject` function in VBScript is frequently used to access COM objects or other resources. If the object or resource is unavailable (e.g., a file doesn't exist, or a COM component isn't registered), the function throws an error, potentially halting script execution.

## Solution
The solution involves using error handling (`On Error Resume Next`) to catch the error and provide appropriate feedback or alternative actions.  This prevents the script from crashing and allows for more controlled behavior.
